\section*{Meeting Time}

Our team meeting with our CP guide, Natasha Thakur, will occur on \textbf{Thursdays at 6 pm in front of Kaprielian Hall}.

\section*{Project Idea}

We are planning to build a web application that will function as a ‘CP Locator’ for CPs to mark
their office hour location in SAL on a page that students can view by accessing the app.
\\ \\
The main function will be a graphical user interface with a floor map of SAL where CPs
can mark their location. There will be a password-protected account functionality for CPs,
while students can view as guests to make sure all CP information can only be entered by CPs.
We are also planning to build an office-hours queue that enables students to enter their information so
that they can be helped by a CPs in order.
\\ \\
We will be using the Twilio (or similar messaging) API to send
notifications to students when they’re at the front of the queue, thereby fulfilling the multi-threading and
networking functionality requirements.
